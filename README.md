# Trustly challenge

This project is related to a challenge made by Trustly, which aims to create an API to consult information from github repositories.

The project is a standard Maven project, so you can import it to your IDE of choice. It is also configured with Spring Boot.

## You can test the App through the links:

Returns the total number of lines and bytes for a given github repository. Grouped by extension.
https://emilianopessoa.herokuapp.com/api/github?url=https://github.com/scrapinghub/sample-projects

Returns the number of lines and bytes of each file from a given github repository.
https://emilianopessoa.herokuapp.com/api/github?url=https://github.com/scrapinghub/sample-projects&grouped=false

Note that the root file will always bring the total number of lines and bytes of the children nodes.

## Running and debugging the applcation

Note: After any 'Running' procedure below open this example link http://localhost:8080/api/github?url=https://github.com/scrapinghub/sample-projects in your browser. 
Note that you can change "https://github.com/scrapinghub/sample-projects" for any public repository. 

### Running the application from the command line.
To run from the command line, go to project folder, execute `./mvnw spring-boot:run` and open the example link above.

### Running and debugging the application in Intellij IDEA
